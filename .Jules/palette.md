## 2025-05-22 - [Keyboard Shortcuts and Semantic Checkboxes]
**Learning:** Keyboard shortcuts should be visually hinted in placeholders (e.g., [/]) to improve discoverability. Also, custom-styled checkboxes using 'div' elements break accessibility and should be replaced with semantic 'input[type="checkbox"]' elements with ARIA labels.
**Action:** Always check for interactive elements that could be more semantic and ensure all keyboard shortcuts have visual cues.
