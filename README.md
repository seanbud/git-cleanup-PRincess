So you're an indie dev. You're reviewing your PR before submitting it, and you realize you accidentally pushed some materials and shader changes — but you didn't mean to. What a pain...

**Let the PRincess help!** She'll help you:

- 🔍 **Figure out what files changed** in this PR
- 🗑️ **Remove any files** you shouldn't have pushed *(safely moved to your Recycle Bin)*
- ♻️ **Restore any changes** you shouldn't have pushed

...so you can keep your kingdom clean and tidy!
