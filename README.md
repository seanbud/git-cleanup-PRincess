# Git Cleanup PRincess

So you're an indie dev. You're reviewing your PR before submitting it, and you realize you accidentally pushed some materials and shader changes—but you didn't mean to. What a pain...

Let the PRincess help! She'll help you:
- Figure out what files changed in this PR
- Remove any files you shouldn't have pushed
- Restore any changes you shouldn't have pushed

...so you can keep your kingdom clean and tidy!

## Professional Cleanup for Modern Devs

### Features
- Interactive character sprites that react to your cleanup actions.
- Safe deletion system that moves files to the system Recycle Bin instead of permanent erasure.
- High-fidelity diff viewer for surgical change review.

- Seamless GitHub authentication and repository management.
