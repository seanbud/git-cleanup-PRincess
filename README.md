# Git Cleanup PRincess

So you're an indie dev. You're reviewing your PR before submitting it, and you realize you accidentally pushed some materials and shader changes—but you didn't mean to. What a pain...

Let the PRincess help! She'll help you:
- Figure out what files changed before submitting your PR
- Remove any files you shouldn't have pushed
- Restore any changes you shouldn't have pushed

...so you can keep your kingdom clean and tidy!
