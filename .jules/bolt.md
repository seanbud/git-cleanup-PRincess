## 2025-05-14 - [React List Rendering Pattern]
**Learning:** Found a common anti-pattern where a memoized list item component (`FileListItem`) was defined but not used in the main rendering loop, leading to unnecessary re-renders of all list items on every state change.
**Action:** Always verify that memoized sub-components are actually used in the render method and that callbacks passed to them are either stable or handled via custom comparison in `React.memo`.

## 2025-05-15 - [High-Frequency Animation Optimization]
**Learning:** High-frequency animations (floating, eye tracking) using JS intervals and state updates were causing major CPU bottlenecks in multi-select views. CSS keyframes are superior for periodic movement, and direct DOM manipulation via Refs is more efficient for mouse tracking to avoid React reconciliation overhead.
**Action:** Use nested wrappers for multi-axis CSS animations to avoid property conflicts. Use direct attribute updates (e.g., setAttribute) on SVG elements for high-frequency tracking interaction.
