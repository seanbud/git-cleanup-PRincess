## 2025-05-14 - [React List Rendering Pattern]
**Learning:** Found a common anti-pattern where a memoized list item component (`FileListItem`) was defined but not used in the main rendering loop, leading to unnecessary re-renders of all list items on every state change.
**Action:** Always verify that memoized sub-components are actually used in the render method and that callbacks passed to them are either stable or handled via custom comparison in `React.memo`.
