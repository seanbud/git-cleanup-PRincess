## 2026-02-19 - API Key Leak via Vite Define
**Vulnerability:** Sensitive API keys (GEMINI_API_KEY) were being bundled into the frontend JavaScript via Vite's `define` configuration.
**Learning:** Even if an environment variable is not explicitly used in the source code, including it in the `define` block of `vite.config.ts` makes it accessible to anyone who inspects the client-side artifacts.
**Prevention:** Only expose public configuration to the frontend. Manage all secrets in the Electron main process and never use `define` or the `VITE_` prefix for sensitive data.
